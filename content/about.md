# About

Hey, I'm Ahmad Hassan -- a Software Engineer and Full Stack Developer from Pakistan. I currently work at [VieroMind](https://vieromind.com) and study at MNS University of Agriculture, Multan. I build web applications, contribute to open source, and write about things I learn along the way.

## Beyond Code

I'm an Arch Linux user running a Hyprland setup -- I like my tools fast, minimal, and keyboard-driven. Neovim is my primary editor, Zsh is my shell, and I try to keep things distraction-free. You can see my full setup on the [tools page](/tools/).

When I'm not coding, I'm usually reading about productivity and self-improvement, customizing my Linux desktop, or exploring new tech.
